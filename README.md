# Multiple Providers
From now bot includes multiple providers (Thanks for [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)).<br>
For responding, bot tries all providers one by one to respond and breaks the loop in first valid response. So you don't have to select provider.
If non of providers worked, bot will tell you to generate your prompt again.<br>
**List of available providers**:
+ **FakeOpen Ai** (uses model ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo)
+ **Fstha Chat** (uses model ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo)
+ **DeepInfra AI** (uses model Llama 2 70b Chat hf)
+ **Online GPT** (uses model ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo)
+ **Free GPT 4** (uses ChatGPT 4)
+ **GPT 4 Free** (uses ChatGPT 4) [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free)
+ **Uncensored AI**: (uses Llama 3 70b)
You can send `/settings` command to bot to change these providers (Enable/Disable)

<br>

# ▋Bot is Down? Not working?
Since bot is supporting multiple providers now, you can use `/ping` to check which one is working.

# ▋Clone Repository
To get started, first you need to **clone** this repository from github into your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kourva/AwesomeChatGPTBot
```
> if you dont have git or python you can install it from your package manager!

<br>

# ▋Install Requirements
Then you have to install requirements before running bot
1. Navigate to bot directory
2. Install requirements using pip
```bash
cd AwesomeChatGPTBot
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install **pyTelegamBotAPI** and **Requests** for you, You can also install them manually if you got any error:
```bash
pip install pyTelegamBotAPI Requests
```

<br>

# ▋Configure your token
Now you have to create bot from [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) **(If you don't have)** and get your **Token** to start working with your bot.<br>
After getting **Token** from **BotFather** replace the Token in `token.txt`
```plaintext
0000000000:AAE7fbH29UPOKzlHlp0YDr9o06o_NdD4DBk
```
You can use editors like 'nano' or 'vim' in Termux or using echo command to write token to file:
```bash
echo "0000000000:AAE7fbH29UPOKzlHlp0YDr9o06o_NdD4DBk" > token.txt
```
> This is just an example Token. 

<br>

# ▋Configure the bot commands (Optional)
you can set your bot's commands manually or using 'init.py' script
```bash
python init.py
```
> This will set up these commands in bot's menu
> + `/start`
> + `/help`
> + `/ping`
> + `/chat`
> + `/features`
> + `/history`
> + `/reset`
> + `/danmode`
> + `/tts`
> + `/settings`

<br>

# ▋Launch the bot
Now you are ready to launch your bot in polling mode inside your terminal using python
```bash
python main.py
```
You can also use **proxychains** to run your bot via **Tor** proxy
```bash
proxycahins python main.py
```
Or in quiet mode
```bash
proxychains -q python main.py
```
To install proxychains install `proxychains-ng` and then edit the config file in `/etc/proxychains.conf`.<br>
It depends on you to use `strict_chain` or `dynamic_chain`. Config it by yourself.
<br>

# ▋TOR new IP address
If you got any denied requests that blocked your Ip address, you can renew your IP
```bash
sudo killall -HUP tor
```
And if you want to check your TOR status, use this command:
```bash
proxychains curl https://check.torproject.org/api/ip
```

<br>

# ▋Bot Inline Mode
Don't forget to enable **Inline Mode** in your bot.<br>
See documentation here: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inline-mode
